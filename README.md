Brief Summary 

The Gaming Room is a client who needed assistance in developing a web-based version of their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It. This game, inspired by the 1980s television show Win, Lose, or Draw, involves teams competing to guess what is being drawn from a library of stock images. The client required the game to be accessible across multiple platforms, support multiple teams and players, ensure unique game and team names, and manage game instances effecitvely. 


Client and Software Requirements 

The Gaming Room needed:
- A web-based version of the game accessible on multiple platforms.
- Support for multiple teams and players with unique names.
- Only one instance of the game running in memory at any given time.
- Effective management of game instances using unique identifiers.


Documentation Development 

In developing the documentation, I particularly excelled in clearly articulating the executive summary and design constraints. I provided a concise yet comprehensive overview of the client's needs and the proposed solutions, ensuring that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could understand the project scope and objectives. 


Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the evaluation section. I would incorporate more detailed comparisons between traditional and cloud-based operating platforms, providing a clearer rationale for the chosen platform. Adding more specific examples and data points could enhance the document's credibility and comprehensiveness. 


User Needs Interpretation

Understanding and implementing the user's needs were crucial in the software design process. By prioritizing the client's requirements, such as ensuring unique game and team names and supporting multiple teams, I was able to design a system that emets their expectations. Considering user needs ensures the final product is user-friendly, functional, and aligned with the client's goals. 


Design Approach 

In designing the software, I adopted a methodical approach: 
- Requirement Analysis: Detailed analysis of the client's requirements.
- UML Diagrams: Visual representation of the system's structure and relationships.
- Design Patterns: Use of design patterns like Singleton and Iterator for efficient instance management and unique name validation.
- Iterative Development: An iterative approach for development, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
